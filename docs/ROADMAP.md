# DeskPort roadmap

Status: bootstrap, 2026-09-09. This is a development tree, not a stable release.

## Product goal

Keep a remote desktop ready in the background. Recall it on the current local
workspace with one action, work normally, then tuck it away without reconnecting.
The first target is a KDE Wayland / AMD Linux client and a macOS Sunshine host.
Windows and macOS clients are intended follow-ups; they are not yet validated.

## Implemented in the bootstrap

- Moonlight Qt v6.1.0 source and upstream Git ancestry.
- DeskPort executable, application/configuration identity and Linux desktop entry.
- Windowed, absolute-pointer defaults; mute on focus loss; background gamepad,
  game optimization and Discord presence disabled by default.
- Upstream update checks disabled for the independent development version.
- Pinned Nix build and development shell for Linux.

## Next action: persistent-session prototype

1. Diagnose input with the unchanged Moonlight/Sunshine path, including host
   permissions and interaction with a software KVM. Do not hide an input failure
   behind a new application shell.
2. Separate session lifetime from window visibility: add explicit show, hide,
   disconnect and quit operations. Do not treat a frozen frame as a live session.
3. Prototype one-action recall on the current KDE workspace; return held keys,
   buttons and input capture when the window is hidden or loses focus.
4. Measure recall time, fresh-frame time and input response separately; measure
   background bandwidth and CPU/GPU use before choosing an idle policy.

Acceptance: 50 hide/show cycles on the same healthy streaming session, no new
stream launch per recall, no stuck input, and a local escape that remains usable.
Window appearance under 200 ms is a target to measure, not a current result.
Initial connection, sleeping hosts and network recovery are separate cases.

## Then: daily development

- Session-scoped text clipboard, followed by PNG; no initial clipboard overwrite,
  echo loops or silent loss of oversized data.
- Explicit local/remote shortcut handling; native host IME first.
- Reconnection that preserves remote applications and returns local control.
- Fixed resolution/scale profiles, with text clarity checked on real hardware.
- Ten disconnect/reconnect trials; 100 bilingual/multiline clipboard samples;
  three two-hour development sessions before asking 3–5 developers to try it.

## Deferred

Individual remote application windows, multi-display roaming, file drag/drop,
USB redirection, local IME preedit forwarding, cloud accounts, mobile clients,
installer signing and automatic updates. Do not refactor the decoder or protocol
unless a measured blocker requires it.
